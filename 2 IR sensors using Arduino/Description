IR Object Detection Using Arduino (Two Sensors)
üß© Overview

This Arduino project demonstrates how to interface two Infrared (IR) obstacle detection sensors with an Arduino board. The system continuously reads both sensors and reports whether an object is detected in front of either sensor through the Serial Monitor.
It can be used in applications such as robot navigation, line following, or collision avoidance.

‚öôÔ∏è Components Used
Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
1- 2 √ó IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensors (with OUT pins)
2- Jumper Wires
3- USB Cable for Programming and Power

üîå Pin Configuration
Component	                Arduino Pin	                Description
IR Sensor 1 (OUT)	            D7	            Digital input for first sensor
IR Sensor 2 (OUT)	            D8	            Digital input for second sensor
IR Sensors (VCC)	            5V	            Power supply for sensors
IR Sensors (GND)	            GND	            Common ground


Each sensor typically has three pins:

VCC (5V) ‚Äì Power supply
GND ‚Äì Ground
OUT ‚Äì Digital signal output (LOW when object detected, HIGH when clear)

üíª Code Explanation

The Arduino continuously reads digital signals from both IR sensors.
When an object is in front of a sensor, its output becomes LOW.
The Serial Monitor displays the detection status for each sensor.
