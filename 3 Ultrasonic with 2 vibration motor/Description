Project with Three Ultrasonic Sensors and Two Vibration Motors
This Arduino-based project integrates three ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) and two A-3ONE3 encapsulated vibration motors (8000 ± 2000 RPM) to detect nearby objects and provide vibration feedback. The system measures distance around the setup and triggers vibration motors according to object detection logic.

Power: Motors can be powered directly from Arduino 5 V if current draw is small. For stronger vibration or longer run time, an external 3–5 V source is recommended. All grounds must be common.
Operating Logic
•	Motor 1 ON: Sensor 1 detects an object within the set threshold.
•	Motor 2 ON: Sensor 2 detects an object within the set threshold.
•	Both Motors ON:
    o	Sensors 1 and 2 detect objects simultaneously, or
    o	Sensor 3 detects an object.
•	All Motors OFF: No detection within the threshold distance.
Default detection threshold: 50 cm (adjustable in code).
Software
    •	Arduino sketch continuously measures distance from all three ultrasonic sensors.
    •	Applies logic to control the two vibration motors for real-time object alerting.
    •	Uses transistors and diodes for safe motor switching.

Transistor and Resistor (for each motor)
For each motor, build this small sub-circuit on the breadboard:
    •	Transistor placement:
        o	Flat side facing you. From left to right, the pins are Collector (C) – Base (B) – Emitter (E).
        o	Insert so each pin is on a separate breadboard row.
    •	Collector (C): Connect to the motor’s positive terminal.
    •	Emitter (E): Connect to the ground rail.
    •	Base (B): Connect to Arduino pin 8 (Motor 1) or pin 9 (Motor 2) through a 1 kΩ resistor.

This arrangement lets the Arduino switch the motors safely using very little current.

Diode (for each motor)
    •	Place a 1N4007 diode directly across each motor’s two terminals to protect against voltage spikes.
    •	Cathode (marked with a silver band) → Motor positive side.
    •	Anode (unmarked side) → Motor negative side.
