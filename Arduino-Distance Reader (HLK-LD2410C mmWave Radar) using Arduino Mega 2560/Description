Overview

This sketch demonstrates how to connect the HLK-LD2410C millimeter-wave radar sensor to an Arduino Mega 2560 R3 using UART communication (Serial3) to extract only the moving-target distance.
It continuously parses the binary UART frames coming from the radar and prints the movement distance (in cm) to the Serial Monitor in real time.

Unlike versions that rely on the sensor’s digital OUT pin, this program decodes the raw UART data directly — giving you access to the actual measured distances.

🔌 Pin Configuration
HLK-LD2410C Pin	                                              Arduino Mega 2560 Pin	                                                Description
TX	                                                              RX3 (pin 15)	                                          Sensor → Mega (Serial3 input)
VCC	                                                            5 V (or 3.3 V if preferred)	                                        Power supply
GND	                                                                    GND	                                                        Common ground
RX	                                                                (not used)	                                    Optional TX3 (pin 14) if you need to send configuration commands


⚠️ Logic-Level Note
The HLK-LD2410C’s RX pin is 3.3 V tolerant.
If you later connect Mega TX3 → HLK RX, use a voltage divider (≈ 3.3 kΩ to RX, 1.8 kΩ to GND).

⚙️ Configuration Parameters

HLK_BAUD	                                            256000 bps	                              Default UART speed of LD2410C module
MAXF	                                                128 bytes	                                    Buffer size for frame storage

🧠 How It Works

1- Serial Listening: The Arduino reads bytes from Serial3 (the radar’s TX line).
2- Frame Detection: It searches for frame headers (F4 F3 F2 F1) and tails (F8 F7 F6 F5) to identify valid HLK data frames.
3- Payload Decoding: Within each frame, the code extracts only the move-distance field (in centimeters).
4- Output: The measured distance of a moving object is printed to the Serial Monitor as:

Output: Move=XXcm
where XX is the detected distance.
