Doppler Radar & Ultrasonic Object Detection System (Arduino)

🧭 Overview

This project integrates a BGT24LTR11 Doppler Radar and a single-pin Ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino microcontroller to detect moving objects, estimate their approach speed, and measure distance simultaneously. When an object is approaching within 50 cm at a reasonable speed (< 100 m/s), an audible buzzer alarm is activated as an early warning signal.

This setup is suitable for collision avoidance, smart vehicle safety systems, bicycle or robotic proximity alert, and IoT-based early warning applications.

BGT24LTR11 Doppler Radar	            Measures object motion and speed	        Communicates via serial (115200 bps)
Ultrasonic Sensor (Single Pin Type)	  Measures distance	                        Trigger and Echo share one SIG pin
Buzzer	                              Audio warning output	                    Activated when object detected within threshold distance
Jumper Wires & Breadboard	            Connections	                              Standard prototyping setup

📡 Pin Connections
Arduino Pin	  Connected Component	      Description
D2	          Radar RX	                Receives serial data from radar
D3	          Radar TX	                Transmits serial data to radar
D4	          Buzzer	                  Digital output – activates alarm
D5	          Ultrasonic Sensor (SIG)	  Combined Trigger/Echo pin
5V / GND	    All sensors	              Power supply

Note: SoftwareSerial is used to communicate with the radar module, so hardware UART remains available for debugging via USB Serial Monitor.


🧠 Working Principle

Doppler Radar (BGT24LTR11):
Detects motion and determines the target’s relative speed (in m/s).
Provides target state:
2 → Approaching
1 → Leaving
0 → No target
Ultrasonic Sensor:
Sends a 10 µs trigger pulse and measures the return echo.
Calculates distance in centimeters using duration / 58.0.

Control Logic:
When target state = 2 (approaching) and distance < 50 cm and speed < 100 m/s,
→ Buzzer ON (digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, HIGH)).
Otherwise, buzzer remains OFF with debug messages shown in the Serial Monitor.

🧾 Serial Output Example
Speed: 0.83 m/s
Distance: 42 cm
🚨 Approaching object <50 cm & <100 m/s → Buzzer ON
