# Dual Ultrasonic Distance Detection with Independent Buzzer Alerts

This project demonstrates how to use two ultrasonic sensors to measure distance and activate two independent buzzers when objects are detected within 30 cm.
Each buzzer corresponds to one sensor ‚Äî allowing the system to indicate the direction (e.g., left or right) of the detected obstacle.
This setup is suitable for parking assistance, collision avoidance, or directional proximity alert applications.

üîß Hardware Components

1 √ó Arduino UNO (or compatible board)

2 √ó Ultrasonic Sensors (e.g., HC-SR04 single-pin mode)

2 √ó Piezo Buzzers

Breadboard and jumper wires

‚öôÔ∏è Pin Configuration
Component	                    Arduino         Pin	Description
Ultrasonic Sensor 1 (SIG)	    D2	            Signal pin for distance measurement (e.g., left sensor)
Ultrasonic Sensor 2 (SIG)	    D3	            Signal pin for distance measurement (e.g., right sensor)
Buzzer 1	                    D4	            Activates when Sensor 1 detects an object closer than 30 cm
Buzzer 2	                    D5	            Activates when Sensor 2 detects an object closer than 30 cm

Both sensors share VCC = 5 V and GND connections with the Arduino.

üñ•Ô∏è Example Serial Output
Distance 1: 18 cm    Distance 2: 42 cm
Distance 1: 35 cm    Distance 2: 25 cm


In this example, Buzzer 1 activates for the left side (18 cm), while Buzzer 2 activates for the right side (25 cm).

üéØ Why Two Buzzers?

Using two buzzers instead of one provides directional awareness.

If only Buzzer 1 sounds ‚Üí the obstacle is on the left side.

If only Buzzer 2 sounds ‚Üí the obstacle is on the right side.

If both buzzers sound ‚Üí obstacles are present on both sides.

This design makes it easier for the user (or driver) to react quickly and safely.
