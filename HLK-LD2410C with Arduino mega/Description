HLK-LD2410C mmWave Radar — Distance-Only Detection (Arduino Mega 2560 R3)

🧩 Overview
This Arduino project demonstrates how to interface the HLK-LD2410C millimeter-wave radar sensor with an Arduino Mega 2560 R3 using UART communication only (no OUT pin required).
The sketch reads the sensor’s serial data frames, extracts distance and presence information, applies a 50 cm detection threshold, and prints Yes or No to indicate object presence.

This implementation is robust against noise and firmware-independent, automatically handling both common HLK frame formats.

🔌 Pin Configuration
HLK-LD2410C Pin	                            Arduino Mega 2560 R3 Pin	                                  Description
TX	                                                  RX1 (Pin 19)	                          Sensor transmits serial data to Mega
RX	                                                  TX1 (Pin 18)	                          Mega transmits configuration data (optional) to sensor
VCC	                                                  5 V (or 3.3 V if required)	            Power supply
GND	                                                  GND	                                    Common ground

⚠️ Note: When connecting Mega TX1 (18) → Sensor RX, use a voltage divider (e.g., 3.3 kΩ to RX, 1.8 kΩ from RX to GND) to reduce 5 V logic to 3.3 V safe levels.

⚙️ Parameters (Adjustable in Code)
Parameter	                                                      Default	                                          Purpose
SENSOR_BAUD	                                                    256000	                      Sensor serial baud rate (set to 115200 if required)
THRESH_CM	                                                        50 cm	                      Detection threshold distance
HYSTERESIS	                                                      2 cm	                      Adds stability (object must move > 52 cm to reset “No”)
NOISE_FLOOR	                                                      5 cm	                      Ignores false readings below 5 cm
WINDOW_MS	                                                        1200 ms	                    Data collection window for frame analysis

💻 How It Works
Frame Parsing:
The code reads binary data frames from the radar sensor and detects their header/tail patterns.

Distance Extraction:
It parses the payload to extract the nearest detected distance in cm (or mm → cm auto-converted).

Presence Logic:
If a target is detected within ≤ 50 cm (THRESH_CM), the system prints "Yes" — otherwise "No".

Noise Filtering:
Multiple consistent readings are required within a 1.2 s window to reduce false triggers.

Serial Output:
The status and debug lines are printed to the Serial Monitor for observation.

📊 Expected Serial Monitor Output (baud rate = 115200)
Yes  dbg presence=1 nearest_cm=42
No  dbg presence=0 nearest_cm=-1
Yes  dbg presence=1 nearest_cm=48

Meaning:
Yes → object detected within 50 cm
No → no nearby target detected
Debug lines show raw presence bit and computed nearest distance in centimeters

🧠 Results & Applications
Provides reliable short-range detection (≈ 0–100 cm) using the HLK-LD2410C.
No need for the sensor’s digital OUT pin — full data is parsed via UART.
Useful for collision avoidance, proximity sensing, smart bicycles, or IoT distance-based triggers.
