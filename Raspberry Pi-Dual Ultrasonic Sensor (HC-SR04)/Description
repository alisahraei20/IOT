🟢 Dual Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) with Raspberry Pi 5

  This project demonstrates how to connect two HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors to a Raspberry Pi 5, read distance measurements quickly and reliably, and avoid common issues such as false long-distance readings and GPIO damage.

  The project is suitable for beginners and can be extended to applications such as parking systems, obstacle detection, safety systems, and IoT projects.

🔧 Hardware Requirements

  Raspberry Pi 5

  2 × HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors

  Breadboard

  Jumper wires (male–female)

  Resistors (for each sensor):

  1 × 1kΩ

  1 × 2kΩ

⚠️ Important:
  Raspberry Pi GPIO pins operate at 3.3V, while the HC-SR04 Echo pin outputs 5V.
  A voltage divider is mandatory to protect the Raspberry Pi.

⚡ Power Connections

Both ultrasonic sensors share the same power rails.

Raspberry Pi Pin	Connection
Pin 2 (5V)	Breadboard + (Red rail)
Pin 6 (GND)	Breadboard − (Blue rail)

For each sensor:

VCC → Red (+) rail

GND → Blue (−) rail

📌 GPIO Pin Assignment
  Ultrasonic Sensor 1
  Function	GPIO (BCM)	Physical Pin
  TRIG1	GPIO 23	Pin 16
  ECHO1	GPIO 24	Pin 18 (via voltage divider)
  Ultrasonic Sensor 2
  Function	GPIO (BCM)	Physical Pin
  TRIG2	GPIO 17	Pin 11
  ECHO2	GPIO 27	Pin 13 (via voltage divider)

🔒 Voltage Divider (Echo Pin Protection)

Each Echo pin must have its own voltage divider:

✔ Reduces 5V → ~3.3V
✔ Prevents permanent GPIO damage
✔ Required for each sensor independently
