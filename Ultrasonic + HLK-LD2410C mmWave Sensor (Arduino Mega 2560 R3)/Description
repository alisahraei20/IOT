Ultrasonic + HLK-LD2410C mmWave Sensor Integration (Arduino Mega 2560 R3)
üß© Overview

This project combines an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and a HLK-LD2410C millimeter-wave radar to measure distance and detect nearby objects.
It prints both sensor readings separately on the Serial Monitor and outputs YES/NO decisions based on a 50 cm detection threshold, along with a combined ANY flag when either sensor detects an object.

The HLK-LD2410C is read through UART frames (no OUT pin used), using a strict binary frame parser to avoid false readings.

‚ö†Ô∏è Voltage Divider: Use a simple divider (e.g., 3.3 kŒ© to RX and 1.8 kŒ© from RX‚ÜíGND) on the LD2410C RX line to protect the 3.3 V logic input from Arduino‚Äôs 5 V TX1.

üß† Working Principle

Ultrasonic Sensor:
The HC-SR04 measures distance by timing the echo pulse. If the measured distance ‚â§ 50 cm, it reports YES.

mmWave Radar (LD2410C):
The Arduino reads UART frames from the radar module, validates them with strict header/tail matching, and extracts the nearest distance in centimeters.
Distances ‚â§ 50 cm are marked YES.

Combined Decision:
If either sensor detects an object (YES), the system sets ANY=YES.

Output Format:
Results are continuously printed to the Serial Monitor at 115200 baud.

üìü Expected Serial Output
US=37cm [YES] | MM=42cm [YES] | ANY=YES
US=61cm [NO]  | MM=45cm [YES] | ANY=YES
US=78cm [NO]  | MM=n/a [NO]   | ANY=NO
US=n/a [NO]   | MM=32cm [YES] | ANY=YES


Explanation:

US ‚Üí Ultrasonic distance reading
MM ‚Üí Millimeter-wave radar reading
ANY ‚Üí Combined trigger flag (YES if either detects an object ‚â§ 50 cm)

üßæ Results
Real-time distance measurement from both sensors displayed in centimeters
Clear YES/NO decision for each sensor and combined detection status
Reliable detection due to strict UART frame parsing for the HLK-LD2410C
Ideal for collision avoidance, smart bicycle systems, parking assist, or IoT distance detection projects
